I provided in this folder the JSON for a set of FHIR operations performed using POSTMAN 
1. I need to translate them into a set of operations using curl. We can choose to run all the operations or any of them, please identify them with a unique identifier.
2. For those resources including extensions, we will replace them with the extensions found in @new_extension.json
