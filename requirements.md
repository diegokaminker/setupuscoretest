I need to setup a FHIR HAPI Server based on Postgresql, loaded with LOINC, SNOMED and all required codesystems and valuesets for the current version of the US CORE implementation guide
This setup needs to be in a docker file, ready to load in an amazon AWS instance.
This version of US Core: https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/
